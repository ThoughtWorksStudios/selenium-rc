this is the list of things to do:

  $ bundle install      #=> Get yer dependencies
  * edit Thorfile with the path to the latest Selenium Jar
  $ thor joe:download   #=> downloads the latest Selenium Jar file
  $ rake                #=> make sure they're green
  $ manually edit lib/selenium-rc/version.rb with the desired version because gem-release is too dumb to do it right
  $ manually edit selenium-rc.gemspec to contain the version # can't gem-release do this for us???
  $ manually edit the README.markdown to update the version of the gem
  $ manually edit the README.markdown to update the version of the new selenium-rc jar (which you pasted in Thorfile)
  $ git commit everything thus far
  $ gem build selenium-rc.gemspec
